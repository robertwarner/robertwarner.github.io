# How to win the week (HTWTW)!

Good morning! I'm writing this on a monday morning as the first thing I do after showering.

I think keeping a weekly post about my goals, and todo list is a healthy and 
noble purpose for the blog.

## Fitness Goals
 - Attend 2 OTF classes this week.
    - Attending 2 more this week will get me to 5 total classes for the month.
    - Not good, but better than where I'm at.
    - I think Tuesday and Thursday are the best options since Sydney is sore.
 - 2 days of Yoga with Adriene
    - Keep at it!
 - Hike in the flatirons
    -  Activitiy for Monday evening.
 - Trip to the Spot!
    - A nice Wednesday afternoon climb!

## Big goals
