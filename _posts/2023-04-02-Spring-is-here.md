# How to win the week (HTWTW)!

Hello future reader. I'm presently watching a [YouTube video of a guy bike-pack the colorado trail](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzCxqzYeUf0). It's amazingly impressive and inspirational for my own journeys. I'd love to bike-pack one day; though, that video in particular is not an inspiration (it rains on him like 10 days in a row). 

# Events from last week

 - I bought the Santa Cruz Hightower!
