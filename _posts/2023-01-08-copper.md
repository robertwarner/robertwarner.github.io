# Copper Mountain

Syd and I arrived at the Apline Lot (the free-commuter lot) around 8:30, and rode the Super Bee lift as soon as it opened at 9 A.M. 

We started the day on a horrendously bumpy run, fittingly named Bouncer. This was one of the worst warm up runs ever, but Syd and I did great on it, which it set the mood for the day.

We rode the Super Bee again, but this we headed down "Andy's Encore" then onto "Cabin Chute". This was one of the best runs of the day. Deep powder, and forgiving mogules. Half way down, Syd and I sat in a blanket of powdery-snow and ate an amazing tasting peanut butter cliff bar. 

Here's some video of Cabin Chute:
