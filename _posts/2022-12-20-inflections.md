An inflection point is the point on a curve when the path changes from concave upward to concave downward. I strongly believe that the stories that we tell ourselves as we go through life are full of inflection points. They are the moments that the mood changes, your perspective shifts, new realizations are found. Depending on the slope of the story you tell yourself, you might miss the point. 

Keep your eye out for inflections. When they happen, reflect on your trajectory. What can you do change? Or would you rather watch it fade away?
