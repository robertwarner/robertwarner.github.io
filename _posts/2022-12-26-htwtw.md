# How to win the week (HTWTW)!

Hello future Rob! I'm presently sitting in front of Sina's fireplace writing this.

# Events from last week
- We experienced a polar plunge. The temperatures dropped to -12 fahrenheit, and something like -40 with wind chill. Sydney and I were hardly affected. Thank god for modern heating. 
- Work was fairly intense. I spent a marority of week writing design docs.
- I can't remember any special evenings during the week, other than, one of the days I did an OTF workout which was super tough.
- Christmas trip to the springs was a major sucess. 
  - 12/23 - Sydney and I arrive in the Springs. Relaxed with Sydney's mom.
  - 12/24 - **Christmas Eve** - Yoga and OTF in the morning. Then we went to REI. I bought Sydney new beanie, and climbing shoes.
    I also purchased these [black diamond ski straps](https://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en_US/product/ski-strap-25in/). I'm not sure how to 
    use them yet, but I think they will aid in hiking in one or another ðŸ¤·. 
    We had lunch at Capriotti's, then went to Fuzzy's for margs, and watched the
    Eagles/Cowboys game. I told Sina that I "bleed green", lol. When we got home,
    I had a family video call on Whatsapp, which was really enjoyable. Later in the evening, Sydney and I went to target and bough Azul, a board game. Then played
    "New Phone who dis" with Kevin and Nate. It was a great evening, and a nice 
    Christmas Eve.
   - 12/25 - **Christmas Day** - We started the day by visiting Will and Terra. We
   had a breakfast feast, then unwrapped gifts. We drove home. Sydney napped, and Seamus, Finley, and I went on a walk to Ute Valley Park. Later, Kim, and Laundie
   came over for Christmas dinner, (which was sourced from Cracker Barrel, but
   delicious). We opened gifts.
