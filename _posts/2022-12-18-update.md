Today I finally got started on publishing my blog. I installed a theme that I'm happy with.

The webiste builds, and has the my only other blog post that I will shortly delete.

I'm mostly happy that I finally have a website going. 

There's a lot to do, but I'd like to modify it just to the point were it feels like my own, and then I'll be done with it for tonight. 

Soon I will start updating this regualarly and become a better writer.
