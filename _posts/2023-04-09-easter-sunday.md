# Spring time -- Changing of seasons

I just did a big clean up of the house. I cleaned the basement as much as I could. Hopefully that leads to more enjoyable spring and summer since it's less frustrating to be down there.

I considered skiing this weekend but ended up against it. I have a feeling the ski season is offically over. 

## Upcomming week plan

Monday -- OTF.
Tuesday -- I think Kevin is coming. Consider rock climbing for half-hour. 
Wednesday -- Mountain bike in Eldora? 
Thursday -- Disc golf with Andrew?
Friday -- OTF.
Saturday -- Shari is comming in the morning.
Sunday -- Scramble? Mountain bike in the morning?

## Best part of last week

Royal Arch hike on saturday morning with Sydney. Lots of snow on the north face. Syd tripped and scrapped her leg on the way down. Overall it was an amazing experience though. She loved the adventure.

## Bike to work

The rule for biking to work is: 

* if it's over 30 degrees
* and there is no rain in the forecast.


## Mountain biking
Goal mountain bike one day this week.

## Scrambling

Plan a scrambing trip for this weekend.


## Orange Theory
Two classes. I really want to keep lifting heavy.


## Disc Golf

Reach out to Andrew to schedule a round. I think Thursday might be perfect.

## Woodworking this week? 

Maybe on way home from work tomorrow.
